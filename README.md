# Combating-Misinformation-in-the-Era-of-Generative-AI-Models
It introduced a recent paper accepted by ACM MM 2023 Brave New Idea (BNI) track --- Combating Misinformation in the Era of Generative AI Models.

# Background:  
With social media perpetuating misinformation spreading, AI generative models rapidly producing multi-modal misinformation, and various misinformation types crafted by malicious actors, the future information environment's health is a cause for concern.

# Motivation: 
This paper examines the issue from psychological and societal perspectivesï¼Œand explores the subtle manipulation traces found throughout the entire information life cycle.

# Contribution: 
We investigate the potential misinformation situations that may emerge with the involvement of generative AI.
We identify influencing factors of misinformation from a social science perspective.
We proposes a conceptual multi-modal misinformation detection framework that analyzes manipulation traces at signal, perceptual, semantic, and human levels, emphasizing on the explainability and generalizability.
